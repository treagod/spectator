## Building, Testing, and Installation

You'll need the following dependencies:
* flatpak-builder

If you are not on elementary OS then you may also have to install the `flatpak` package before compiling.

To build and install, use `flatpak-builder`.

    flatpak-builder buildir com.github.treagod.spectator.yml --install --user --force-clean

Then you can run the app with `flatpak run com.github.treagod.spectator`.

Once you are done testing and want to remove the app, run `flatpak uninstall com.github.treagod.spectator`.

If you instead want to completely remove both the app and its user data, run `flatpak uninstall com.github.treagod.spectator --delete-data`.

Flatpak building is the only officially supported build method, though building in the Debian format is possible via meson:

    meson build --prefix=/usr
    cd build
    ninja

And can then be installed with `sudo ninja install`
